Kali Linux

Kali Linux – a Debian-based Linux widely used for advanced Penetration Testing and Security 
Auditing. Kali Linux has numerous tools for information security, penetration testing, security 
research, computer forensics, and reverse engineering. 

Kali was released in 2013 as complete rebuild of BackTrack Linux and maintained by Offensive Security. 

Here are some of the features and benefits of Kali Linux.

•	More than 600 penetration testing tools
•	Free and always will be
•	Open source Git tree
•	FHS(Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) compliant
•	Wide-ranging wireless device support
•	Custom kernel, patched for injection
•	Developed in a secure environment
•	GPG signed packages and repositories
•	Multi-language support
•	Completely customizable
•	ARMEL and ARMHF support

In summary, Kali Linux was built for penetration testing professionals therefore some familiarity 
with the Linux based OS is expected before using Kali.  


Metasploit

It is a penetration testing framework that makes it easy for hackers – both attackers and defenders. 
The framework work automated a lot of repetitive tasks that hackers used back in the days. 
Metasploit is referred to as the Swiss army chainsaw because of what it can do that wasn’t achievable
prior to its existence. Its core framework in free and already pre-installed in Kali Linux and the pro 
with the GUI is also available for purchase.

The Metasploit framework started in 2003 by HD Moore and it has gone through a tremendous improve and 
eventually was eventually acquired by Rapid7 in 2009. Although it faces competition from Canvas and 
Core Impact, it has become the go-to framework for exploit development. 

The framework can integrate with many tools such as Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration. 
The Metasploit database contains exploits that’ll let you in once you find a weakness. Once the framework
gets on a target machine, the post-exploitation tools enables you to utilize features such as privilege 
escalation, pass the hash, packet sniffing, screen capture, keyloggers, and pivoting tools. 
A persistent backdoor can also be setup in case of a machine reboot. 

Metasploit can be found in different forms and can be learned from different platforms, but it’s always 
best to learn by doing therefore one should practice on the installs that comes with the Linux and Unix 
OS’s or download them if you need to.
