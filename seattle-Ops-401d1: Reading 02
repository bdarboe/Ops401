Security Operations Center

the threat of cybersecurity has become more common and destructive as well as 
difficult to detect. The sophistication of the attacks has made it difficult and longer to 
detect threats, therefore needing the intervention of Security Operations Center (SOC).

SOC is a facility within the organization that hosts the security team which comprises of 
security experts in different respects. The team can help detect threats and prevent 
security breaches from occurring on the organization’s network infrastructure. They’re 
the first responders when an incident occurs within the organization. Both large and 
small organizations can implement a SOC team. 

In organizations, a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) also known as 
CIRT or CERT is an in-house incident response team that may work under SOC or 
stand alone. The functions of SOC and CSIRT are similar in terms of response, but 
CSIRT communicates with clients, executives, and the board about the incidents. 
Although they may be needed in different scenarios, the difference between the two is 
negligible and they can be combined in certain scenarios.
