Security Operations Center

the threat of cybersecurity has become more common and destructive as well as 
difficult to detect. The sophistication of the attacks has made it difficult and longer to 
detect threats, therefore needing the intervention of Security Operations Center (SOC).

SOC is a facility within the organization that hosts the security team which comprises of 
security experts in different respects. The team can help detect threats and prevent 
security breaches from occurring on the organization’s network infrastructure. They’re 
the first responders when an incident occurs within the organization. Both large and 
small organizations can implement a SOC team. 

In organizations, a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) also known as 
CIRT or CERT is an in-house incident response team that may work under SOC or 
stand alone. The functions of SOC and CSIRT are similar in terms of response, but 
CSIRT communicates with clients, executives, and the board about the incidents. 
Although they may be needed in different scenarios, the difference between the two is 
negligible and they can be combined in certain scenarios.

Nagios Monitoring Tool

A tool developed by Linux for monitoring activities on networks in Unix based systems by 
providing all the system related information to the user with a real-time monitoring capability 
of the network and applications. It Helps in identifying performance-based issues and sends 
results when necessary. Nagios can send the results to the administrators notifying them of 
activities on the network. 

The three main components are web interface, daemons, and plugins and mainly four object 
types like commands, notifications, host groups, contact groups, and services. Many network 
services such HTTP and processes such as processor load can be monitored by the tool. Nagios 
may also come in handy for remote monitoring of systems. 

The importance of Nagios is very important in keeping network systems running by detecting 
undesirable activities and enabling the administrators to quickly take appropriate actions 
before any damage is done. 

Nagios has many features supported on a capable architecture that is valuable to an 
organizations network infrastructure. The users can access their applications continuously 
without interruption therefore improving the organization’s bottom-line.
