IAM 

Identity and access management helps in the role definition and management of users and how the roles are used based on the permission given. The goal is to grant access to the user who needs access to the products and services on the network. IAM enables the tracking of user activities on the network and makes it easy for the administrator to quickly identify users when necessary. With an SSO, users can access the system with a single credential that can have multiple authentication to log on to the network. 

IAM is part of organizations' security plan to prevent unauthorize users to gain access to the network and compromise users' data. The rate of ransomeware attacks have risen lately and attackers are asking for very high amount of money which could bring financial havoc. Infrastructural damages may be cause by intruders if their demands are not met by the organization. 

IAM may allow organizations to cater for vendors and outsides customers by allowing access to resources on the network without compromising security. The organization may increase collaboration on key documents and projects without having to have each party work seperately. 

Although it sounds great and very necessary in today's security world, professionals are still concerned about data protection especially when a disgruntle employee illegally shares company's data. The integration of IAM with legacy systems could be risky especially when employees use unauthorized applications that may come with malware that could harm the system. 

In conclusion, IAM could help bridge the gap between department and create an environment that promotes secure login and also help professionals properly manage user credentials.
