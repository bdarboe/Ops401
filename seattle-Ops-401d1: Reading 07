DATA IN TRANSIT VS DATA AT REST

Although data at rest is considered to be more secured than data in motion, this believe could not be far from the truth. Either state of the data, at rest or in transit, needs the implementation of strong security measures to protect the data from falling into the hands of unauthorized users. Companies use end to end encryption to move data from one end to another so that unauthorized users wouldn't be able to read it when intercepted.

Data at rest needs to sit on very well secured infrastructures to protect it from intruders. Attackers may actually find it easy to attack system where data is at rest because the data is at a known location while data in motion has to be intercepted when it is moving from one place to another. 

Nonetheless, it doesn't matter which state data is in, it has to be protected from the falling into the hands of unauthorized users.
