                                                      The Pros & Cons of Intrusion Detection Systems

The security systems of organizations may include a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) among many other systems. Although NID’s can be very useful, there weakness should not be neglected and therefore similar but better products should be given consideration. 
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) sound the alarm when an usual activity or threat is detected on the network, just fire alarms detecting fire. We use these systems to help us react appropriately and accordingly. 
Even though a firewall prevents intruders from penetrating systems, IDS lets the system administrator see activities relating to someone trying to penetrating their network. It is a visibility that monitors network traffic.  An IDS can notify security personnel of infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers, and even configuration errors.
Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
These two are similar except that an IPS can block potential threats and stopping them without the intervention of the system administrator. An IPS is otherwise anther monitoring tool like and IDS, but without proper fine tuning it can also deny legitimate traffic. 
Network Intrusion Detection Systems vs. Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)
These two are used differently as their names implied. NID has a much quicker response that a HID. NID operates on different platforms as it does not need the presence of a specific OS or software to operate.  They’re low cost and easy to setup. 

Pros of Network Intrusion Detection Systems:
•	They Can Be Tuned to Specific Content in Network Packets
•	They Can Look at Data in the Context of the Protocol
•	They Can Qualify and Quantify Attacks
•	They Make It Easier to Keep Up With Regulation
•	They Can Boost Efficiency

Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems:
•	They Will Not Prevent Incidents By Themselves
•	An Experienced Engineer Is Needed to Administer Them
•	They Do Not Process Encrypted Packets
•	IP Packets Can Still Be Faked
•	False Positives Are Frequent
•	They Are Susceptible to Protocol Based Attacks
•	The Signature Library Needs to Be Continually Updated to Detect the Latest Threats
