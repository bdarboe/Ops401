 VPC (virtual private cloud) is a virtual data center in the cloud that gives users the ability to create their own private IP address range, creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways. The benefit of VPC is that it helps in aspects of cloud computing like privacy, security and preventing loss of proprietary data.
 
Basics of a VPC

Subnets: A subnet can be thought of as dividing a large network into smaller networks

Route Tables: A route table contains a set of rules called routes which determine where traffic has to be directed

Internet Gateways (IGW): It is a combination of hardware and software that provides your private networks with a route to the world outside

Network Address Translation (NAT): NAT maps the private IP addresses to the public address on the way out and vice versa on the way in. An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. 

Security groups: Security groups are a set of firewall rules that controls the traffic for your instance. Only "allow" is permissible on Amazon Firewall. 

Customer Gateway — An Amazon VPC VPN connection links your data center (or network) to your Amazon VPC (virtual private cloud). 

Virtual Private Gateway — A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the VPN connection. 

VPN stands for ‘virtual private networking’, which is a popular internet security method which was originally designed for large organisations where employees needed to connect to a certain computer from different locations.

VPC Peering — A VPC peering connection allows you to route traffic between two VPC’s using IPv4 or IPv6 private addresses.

Network Access Control Lists (NACL)— an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. 


                                    AWS
AWS provides a number of efficient, secure connectivity options to help you get the most out of AWS when integrating your remote networks with Amazon VPC. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you’ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
