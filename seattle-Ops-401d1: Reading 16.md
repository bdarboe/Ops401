                                                  Threat Analysis, Cyber Kill-Chain, and Stuxnet

Cybersecurity Kill Chain is defined as a 7 , sequential, step approach an attacker takes to complete a successful attack. It was developed by Lockheed Martin. The step are as follows:
1.	Reconnaissance
2.	Weaponization
3.	Delivery
4.	Exploitation
5.	Installation
6.	Command and Control
7.	Actions on Objectives
If one or more of the 7 steps is broken, the attack will be disrupted, resulting in a failed attack.
In reconnaissance, the attacker tries to gather enough information about the victim in either a passive or active stage. 
In passive reconnaissance, the attacker uses public sources such Google, Facebook, WHOIS, ARIN registrations, Google, Shodan, Job Listings and company website to gather information about the victim. 
The attacker then proceed to interact with the organization with the users credentials. She/he uses tools such nMap among others to gain access to vital information. 
Before utilizing defense tools and techniques to foil this kind of attacks, users should be encouraged to limit sharing important information publicly.   
Weaponization, which is the second step in the seven steps, is when the attacker utilizes the information she/he acquired from the user to exploit the system. 
In this stage, techniques such patch management should be implemented to keep the system up to date on patches in order to prevent unauthorized intrusion.
Once our system is attacked, a post infection tool, like a sandbox or an EDR, will help us detect zero day threats that are preventive measures didn’t detect.
When the attacker selects the weapon to use for the attack, she/he then moves to the Delivery stage where the attacker tries one or multiple avenues to deliver the weapon. Some delivery examples are:  Websites (malicious or clean, social media, user input, email, and USB’s. Besides awareness campaign, support staff may use tools and techniques such as DKIM and SPF email authentication methods to detect spoofed emails. The may also use Web filtering to prevent users from accessing questionable or known bad sites, disabling USB,  DNS filtering to name a few.
