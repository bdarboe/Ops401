                                                      Threat Analysis Using MITRE ATT&C
                                                            
A five year old living document that grew from an internal project to a knowledge document for the public. The researchers’ goal is to break down and classify attacks clearly so that users can compare and contrast the attacks and find out how the attacker exploited the networks and endpoints. 

                                                       Building an effective red team
                          
Introducing a red team into our IT departments is very important in finding and stopping attacks before much damage is done. Having a red team is important in finding and fixing gaps in our firewalls and other components and areas in our system. Red teams can be from among a group of support staff or a professional cybersecurity company. There are several tools such as PowerShell exploits or the BloodHound tool for testing Active Directory-based exploits. However, ATT&CK is one of the more common and comprehensive tools in the market. 

                                                       ATT&CK undergoing constant improvement
                         
The document is a living document as mentioned before, so it continuously being improved. For example: 
•	Combining the various threat matrices into a coherent single document 
•	Hosting ATT&CK on a new wiki platform and making it easier to navigate
•	Developing a new API that can make it easier to interact with ATT&CK using the STIX/TAXII threat sharing schemas
•	Adding better search capabilities
•	Creating a governance committee to decide on future improvements, particularly as more private security vendors begin to offer ATT&CK-based enhancements and tools.
The flexibility of ATT&CK has made it easy for others to take it and add extra features and capabilities to make better.
