Cybersecurity Automation 

To eliminate the need for human intervention and possible errors and negligence, cybersecurity automation may be the ultimate tool to save the day. 


What Is Cybersecurity Automation?

Automation can be done in many different way and cybersecurity automation is to configure cybersecurity tools to automatically perform cybersecurity process without the intervention of the support team except in certain cases. Tools like SOAR and RPA can be used to automatic execute cybersecurity operations.

What Is The Benefit Of Automation?

By implementing automation in an organization’s environment, the cybersecurity team can focus on activities that are more complex. This means that the machine can perform the mundane, repeatable work and cybersecurity team members can devote themselves to more critical, creative and technical work to resolve issues and improve the organizational risk posture. Once the appropriate activities are automated, cybersecurity practitioners can focus on projects such as:

• Engineering and Architecture: Automation will allow the cybersecurity team to focus on designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies, including initiatives such as zero trust and cyber hygiene within the enterprise.

• Remediation Activities: The identified deficiencies from your automation efforts will assist your technical and mission teams by providing more repeatable and actionable insight into the enterprise environment leading to fewer vulnerabilities.

• Automation Development and Engineering: Automation will become an important part of the cybersecurity program requiring its own resources related to ongoing and iterative automation design and implementation.


Three basic approaches to successfully implement automation concepts include:

1. Embed development capabilities in your cybersecurity team. In this way, developers report directly to cyber leadership.

2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational development teams. This allows cybersecurity to leverage the capabilities of organizational development experts.

3. Adopt a hybrid approach. Utilize an internal team for tactical development work and organizational development capabilities for complex integration tasks.

Automation is definitely going to help the security team run the enterprise infrastructure effectively and efficiently in order to focus on more important part of the network and increase the organization's bottom line
