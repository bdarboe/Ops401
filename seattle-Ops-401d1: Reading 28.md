                                                              Introduction

Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is the monitoring of your network for security related events. It might be proactive, when used to identify vulnerabilities or expiring SSL certificates, or it might be reactive, such as in incident response and network forensics. Whether you’re tracking an adversary or trying to keep malware at bay, NSM provides context, intelligence and situational awareness of your network. Enterprise Security Monitoring (ESM) takes NSM to the next level and includes endpoint visibility and other telemetry from your enterprise. Although Security Onion has competitors, but very few can match its security capabilities in one package.

                                                               Overview

Security Onion seamlessly weaves together three core functions:

full packet capture
network and endpoint detection
powerful analysis tools

Full-packet capture: is accomplished via Stenographer. Stenographer captures all the network traffic your Security Onion sensors see and stores as much of it as your storage solution will hold (it has a built-in mechanism to purge old data before your disks fill to capacity). Full packet capture is like a video camera for your network, but better because not only can it tell us who came and went, but also exactly where they went and what they brought or took with them (exploit payloads, phishing emails, file exfiltration).

Network and endpoint detection analyzes network traffic or host systems, respectively, and provide log and alert data for detected events and activity. Security Onion provides multiple options:

Analysis Tools
With full packet capture, IDS alerts, Zeek data, and endpoint telemetry, there is an incredible amount of data available at your fingertips. Fortunately, Security Onion tightly integrates the following tools to help make sense of this data.

Security Onion Console (SOC)
Security Onion Console (SOC) is the first thing you see when you log into Security Onion. It includes a new Alerts interface which allows you to see all of your NIDS and HIDS alerts.

Kibana
Kibana, created by the team at Elastic, allows us to quickly analyze and pivot between all of the different data types generated by Security Onion through a “single pane of glass”. This includes not only NIDS/HIDS alerts, but also Zeek logs and system logs collected via syslog or other agent transport. Kibana can pivot to full packet capture via Security Onion Console (SOC).

CyberChef
CyberChef allows you decode, decompress, and analyze artifacts.

Playbook
Playbook is a web application that allows you to create a Detection Playbook, which itself consists of individual plays. These plays are fully self-contained and describe the different aspects around the particular detection strategy.

Deployment Scenarios
Analysts around the world are using Security Onion today for many different architectures. The Security Onion Setup wizard allows you to easily configure the best installation scenario to suit your needs.

Conclusion
So we have full packet capture, Suricata rule-driven intrusion detection, Zeek event-driven intrusion detection and Wazuh host-based intrusion detection, all running out of the box once you run Security Onion setup. These disparate systems with various dependencies and complexities all run seamlessly together and would otherwise take hours, days or weeks to assemble and integrate on their own. What was once a seemingly impossible task is now as easy as answering a few questions.
