Threat Hunting

The concept is inline with going out there and see or hypothesise scenarios that may occur instead of waiting for something to happen before reacting to it. Threat Hunting an active/proactive activity and not a reactive one. We do an assessment of our network and go out there and look for possible scenarios and create solutions accordingly. 

Security tools falls into either a protection or response base - meaning keeping unauthorized users out or removing them from our network when they get in. To figure out that our protection has failed and respond appropriately before the bad guys get in, we need to threat hunt before the attack occurs.
