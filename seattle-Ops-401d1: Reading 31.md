                                                            YARA Rules

YARA rules (Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym) is a piece of code that conduct searches to find malware in your system. It tracks down malware in your network by using keywords that may be associated with the malware. 

YARA can also search for malware in phishing emails by using the common keywords that attacker use to get users to click on malware infested links. 
Malware samples such as BISTROMATH, HOTCROISSANT and BUFFETLINE used by North Korea, had YARA rules written for them by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Other malware used by North Korea are SLICKSHOES, CROWDEDFLOUNDER, and ARTFULPIE. 

YARA rules are only as good as the information they are based on. If attackers change up some of their code and features, a new rules may have to be written by the defenders.
