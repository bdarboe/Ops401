                                                      What is penetration testing

A penetration test(pen test), is a simulated cyber attack against computer systems to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF). In pen testing, applications may be breached to uncover vulnerabilities

                                                      Penetration testing stages
                                                      
1. Planning and reconnaissance

The first stage involves: Defining the scope and goals of a test and Gathering intelligence 

2. Scanning

The next step is to Static analysis and Dynamic analysis

3. Gaining Access

This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities.

4. Maintaining access

The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system— long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access. 

5. Analysis

The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing:

Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited

Sensitive data that was accessed

The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected

Penetration testing methods

External testing, Internal testing, Blind testing, Double-blind testing, and Targeted testing

Penetration testing and web application firewalls

Penetration testing and WAFs are exclusive, but beneficial security measures.

For many kinds of pen testing (with the exception of blind and double blind tests), the tester is likely to use WAF data, such as logs, to locate and exploit an application’s weak spots.

In turn, WAF administrators can benefit from pen testing data. After a test is completed, WAF configurations can be updated to secure against the weak spots discovered in the test.
