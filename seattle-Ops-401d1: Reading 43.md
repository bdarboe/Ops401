What is Sniffing?

Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network. Sniffers, which can be hardware or software installed in the system, are used by network/system administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic. Attackers use sniffers to capture data packets containing sensitive information.

There are two types:

Active Sniffing:

A switch is a point to point network device. The switch regulates the flow of data between its ports by actively monitoring the MAC address on each port, which helps it pass data only to its intended target, hence active sniffing.

Passive Sniffing:

This is the process of sniffing through the hub. Any traffic that is passing through the non-switched or unbridged network segment can be seen by all machines on that segment. Sniffers operate at the data link layer on the OSI model.
