Traffic Mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for content inspection, Threat monitoring, and Troubleshooting. The three concepts are Target mirroring, target filter, and target mirroring sessions. Traffic mirroring enables simplified operation, enhanced security, and increased monitoring options. 

We can assign traffic mirror session to virtual network ID which may be assigned a value if the user did not do so. 

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use traffic mirror resources.

In traffic monitoring, we follow the following steps in order to achieve our mirroring aims and objectives. 

Step 1: Create the traffic mirror target 
Step 2: Create the traffic mirror filter 
Step 3: Create the traffic mirror session 
Step 4: Analyze the data
