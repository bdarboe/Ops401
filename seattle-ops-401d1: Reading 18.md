                                                           Application Threat Modeling

Threat modelling helps to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations in protecting valuable assets. It can be applied to a wide range of things such as software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, things in the internet of things, and business processes, to name a few. Although it can be done at any stage in product development, threat modeling is encouraged to be done early, so that the findings can inform the design.

                                                                       What

Most of the time, a threat model includes:
•	A description / design / model of what you’re worried about
•	A list of assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
•	A list of potential threats to the system
•	A list of actions to be taken for each threat
•	A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken
Our motto is: Threat modelling: the sooner the better, but never too late.

                                                                        Why

The inclusion of threat modelling in the SDLC can help
•	Build a secure design
•	Efficient investment of resources; appropriately prioritize security, development, and other tasks
•	Bring Security and Development together to collaborate on a shared understanding, informing development of the system
•	Identify threats and compliance requirements, and evaluate their risk
•	Define and build required controls.
•	Balance risks, controls, and usability
•	Identify where building a control is unnecessary, based on acceptable risk
•	Document threats and mitigation
•	Ensure business requirements (or goals) are adequately protected in the face of a malicious actor, accidents, or other causes of impact
•	Identification of security test cases / security test scenarios to test the security requirements

                                                          Four Questions asked in threat modeling are: 

1. What are we building?
•	Architecture diagrams
•	Dataflow transitions
•	Data classifications
•	You will also need to gather people from different roles with sufficient technical and risk awareness to agree on the framework to be used during the Threat Modelling exercise.

2. What can go wrong?
This is a “research” activity in which you want to find the main threats that apply to your application. 

3. What are we going to do about that?

4. Did we do a good enough job?
Carry out a retrospective activity over the work you have done to check quality, feasibility, progress, and/or planning.



Process: The steps seems to follow the lean six sigma methodology and effective project management in order to be executed effectively. 

                                                            When to threat model
When the system changes, you need to consider the security impact of those changes. Threat modelling integrates into Agile by asking “what are we working on, now, in this sprint/spike/feature. After a security incident, going back and checking the threat models can be an important process.
Threat modelling: engagement versus review
Threat modelling at a whiteboard can be a fluid exchange of ideas between diverse participants. Using the whiteboard to construct a model that participants can rapidly change based on identified threats is a high-return activity.
