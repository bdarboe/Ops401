                                                          Malware Analysis
                                                          
The process of breaking down malware into its core components and source code, investigating its characteristics, functionality, origin, and impact to mitigate the threat and prevent future occurrences. Malware is a malicious software designed to penetrate and cause damage to network systems without authorization. 
Malware analysis helps in determining the composition of the malware code, trace its origin among other characteristics to help authorities apprehend the criminals. Attackers uses malware to steal and encrypt company’s data for a ransom – ransomware. 
The definition and objectives of malware analysis are: It breaks down the malware, It investigates its characteristics, it unravels its functionality: It traces the malware’s origin, and It tries to predict the impact 

                                                      Malware Analysis Process:

1.	Capture the malware. 
2.	Build a malware lab. 
3.	Install your tools. 
4.	Record the baseline. 
5.	Commence your investigation. 
6.	Document the results. 

Malware is a very crucial aspect of cyber security therefore governments and organizations work tirelessly help improve the sector to contain the numerous attackers carried out daily. 

                                                      Types of Malware Analysis

1. Static malware analysis 
2. Dynamic malware analysis 
3. Manual malware analysis 
4. Automated malware analysis 

These analysis goes through different stages in order to properly execute an analysis and understand the composition of a malware.

                                                    Key Stages of Malware Analysis

1. Observing malware behavior 
2. Disassembling the code 
Disassembling the code involves both static analysis as well as its inner logic. Three types of tools can help with disassembling code: 
	A disassembler deconstructs the malware into its primitive binary form and reconstructs it into assembly language that’s comprehensible for a human analyst. 
	A debugger conducts a code walkthrough and highlights unusual/suspicious-looking code elements where the malware analyst must investigate further. 
	A decompiler recreates the original source code of a program and can help identify a coder’s digital fingerprint to trace its origin. And 
3. Examining the memory 

                                        The following Analysis are chosen as the current best practices. 

1. Expand your malware sample size continuously. 
2. Use automation to optimize your efforts. 
3. Always use a secure environment to run malware.
4. Only analyze malware whose remote infrastructure is running. 
5. Capture and store VM image snapshots.
6. Do your research and select the best-fit malware analysis tools.

With the hundreds of thousands of malware circulating every day, it is even more important today than ever to understanding and properly utilize the art of malware analysis in order to stay safe.
