PeStudio is an all-in-one surface analysis Windows application for Portable Executables. It can be used in a Windows Virtual Machine dedicated to malware analysis. It can run on its own from a thumbdrive without impacting the integrity of the host being investigated.
We can look at the breakdown of the PeStudio and how to go through some of the installations. Inside the “xml” directory are eleven XML files. These are configuration files which provide input for blacklisted items and to actually configure the application. One useful feature of PeStudio is its ability to lookup a file by hash in VirusTotal. It comes packed with the indicators listed in XML files. To do a complete analysis, the process have to be followed to properly analyze the malware. 


                                                          What is Ghidra and Why is it Important?
                                                          

A large part of tackling new viruses is figuring out how they work. The National Security Agency (NSA) created their own tool, called Ghidra to help them reverse engineer malware in order to see it’s components. It was released to the public for free and as open source on March 5th, 2019.
What is Reverse Engineering and Why is it Used?
Generally, reverse-engineering (RE) refers to the process of taking something apart to figure out how it was made. You may have done this yourself with a small appliance at home, just trying to figure out how to fix it yourself. But we’re talking about RE a program. It’s just code, right? Why don’t we just look at the code behind it?

When you write a program in a language like C or Java, there’s a step between writing it and being able to use it on a computer. The language you’re programming in is readable to you, but not necessarily readable by the computer. It must be translated into something that the computer can work with. This process is called compiling.

Once a program is compiled, it’s no longer readable by humans.
If you want to figure out how that program works, you need to take it apart to the level where you can see what’s in it. You need a toolkit for that, just like you need a toolkit of screwdrivers and wrenches to take about a small appliance or engine.
What Now?

The U.S. federal government has pledged to release more and more security related software. Some of it will be very technical in nature, like Ghidra, and some of it will more user-friendly, like a security-enhanced version of Android.
It all heralds a unique time of government and civilian collaboration towards keeping our data infrastructure  as safe as possible.
