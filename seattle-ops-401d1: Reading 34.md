What is computer forensics?

With the increasing amount of technology, comes an increasing amount of security and privacy issues that surround technology as well. Individuals and businesses are worried about identity theft and privacy invasion due to increasing data breach, identity theft, security issues, illegal activity, and corruption. Forensic computer or cyber experts are key in the battle against cyber threats. Similar to cybersecurity, cyber forensic specialists are charged with helping increase security, fight crime, and create a better, safer future.
Computer forensics careers.
Computer forensics focuses on helping organizations deal with network breaches and also work for law enforcement agencies to investigate security issues, data breaches, and other cyber crimes. These experts recover documents, photos, emails, and other files from computer systems, hard drives, and other devices.
Computer forensics vs. cybersecurity
computer forensics and cybersecurity sound similar but quite different. At the root, cybersecurity is focused on prevention while computer forensics is more reactionary in nature. Cybersecurity experts work to keep hackers out, while computer forensics experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in.
Why is cyber forensics important?
Cyber forensics is important due to the high amount of breaches occurring daily. In 2019 there were over 3,800 publicly disclosed security breaches, with over 4 million records exposed. There is a new hacker attack every 39 seconds, and 300,000 new malware programs are created every day. These statistics makes cyber forensics an increasingly important element of our protection.
