                                                            Metasploit

Metasploit is a penetration testing tool used by many attackers and defenders. Metasploit is pointed at a target, pick an exploit, what payload to drop, and execute. The tool has made it easy for many penetration testing tasks such as Information gathering, gaining access, maintaining persistence, and evading detection to be automated and eliminate the repetition. 

Metasploit was written by HD Moore in 2003 but has grown from the original 11 exploits to more than 1,500 now, plus around 500 payloads. In the information gathering phase of a pentest, Metasploit integrates seamlessly with many reconnaissance tools such as Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration, among others. When a weakness is identified, hunt through Metasploit's large database for the exploit that will get you in the system. 

The exploit is paired with a payload to suit the task at hand. Meterpreter payload is used when attacking Windows systems and Linux systems get their own shellcode, depending on the exploit used. You can use the payload to set up a backdoor in case the machine gets rebooted.

More and more features are being added to Metasploit every year, include a fuzzer to identify potential security flaws in binaries, as well as a long list of auxiliary modules too long to list here. 

Metasploit can be downloaded in order distributions, but it is readily available in Kali Linux.
